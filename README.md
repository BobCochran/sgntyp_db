README for Signtyp Imaging Project

This project contains all the data definition language files and other documentation needed to
create an SQLite version 3.8.x database named imst.db. This is the database to be deployed
with the Signtyp Imaging Project.

The folder structure is as follows:

db---
    |
    ddl---
         |
         sqlite3


(i.e. db/ddl/sqlite3) under which you will find the actual data definition language files
for each table in imst.db.
